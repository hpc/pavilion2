This yaml library is based heavily on the pyyaml library (https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml). It has
been stripped down to include only the essentials:
 - The python3 based library.
 - Unit Tests

It has also been modified significantly from the original.
 - A CommentEvent is now (optionally) expected before each mapping or list item events. 
   - Comments are wrapped when appropriate.
 - Other minor formatting tweaks to tabbing to make comments and the yaml more
   readible. 
 - Other assorted changes, like returning ordered dictionaries instead of 
   plain dictionaries to keep behavior consistent across versions of python3.
