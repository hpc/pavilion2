"""Every test run has a status file that tracks it's progress. It's
one of the first things created (after the test directory itself) when
creating a test object.

A test run will transition through several states (all available as part of the
``status_file.STATES`` object). These, along with a description and timestamp,
are saved as a 'state' in the status file. Each state is a single line of the
file with a max size of 4096 bytes to ensure atomic writes.

The state of a test run represents where that run is in its lifecycle. It
does not represent whether a test passed or failed. States are ephemeral and
asynchronous, and should generally not be used to decide to do something with a
test run. (The only exception is the 'SCHEDULED' state, which tells Pavilion
to ask the scheduler about its current state).

Usage: ::

    status_file = StatusFile('/tmp/mystatus')

    status.set(STATES.RUNNING, "I'm running!")

    state = status.current()

    state.note

Rules:

- The value should be an ascii string of the constant name.
- The constants have a max length of 15 characters.
- The constants are in all caps.
- The constants must be a valid python identifier that starts with a letter.
- Error states should end in '_ERROR'. They should be the result of an OS

- Failure states should end in '_FAILED'. They should be the result of trying
  something, and it just not succeeding.

**Note**: The states are written in the class as ``<state_name> = <help_text>``,
