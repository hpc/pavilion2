"""Every test run has a status file that tracks it's progress. It's
one of the first things created (after the test directory itself) when
creating a test object.

A test run will transition through several states (all available as part of the
``status_file.STATES`` object). These, along with a description and timestamp,
are saved as a 'state' in the status file. Each state is a single line of the
file with a max size of 4096 bytes to ensure atomic writes.

The state of a test run represents where that run is in its lifecycle. It
does not represent whether a test passed or failed.

Usage: ::

    status_file = StatusFile('/tmp/mystatus')

    status.set(STATES.RUNNING, "I'm running!")

    state = status.current()

    state.note
