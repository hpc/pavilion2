# YAML        

#   Default test configuration file, vers. 0.5 

# --------  Basic Instructions -------------

# This file contains what a complete single stanza in a user test suite 
# will contain. Each stanza (test entry) in the user test suite will inherit
# each of its components from this file, unless re-defined.
# Therefore, if you want to effect all the entries during run,
# change this file, otherwise change only the appropriate parts of the user test suite.

# NOTE
#  - All variables in CAPS are nix environment vars
#  - Lines with a "#" are comments.

# A new named stanza or section is needed for each new test,
# but you only need to define what's different from the
# this default test_config file. Simply ommit the part(s) you want to
# inherit.
# In theory, ever part of the default file can be re-used, but it's necessary to 
# at least changing the Id, name, location, and run:cmd sub-elements for each
# new test.
#

# for YAML formatting issues try: http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com

# It is HIGHLY recommended that you make a copy of this file and tweak it as
# needed and make this new file the default_test_config.yaml file.
    

# ---------- Special Directives Section -------------------------------

# These are examples of reserved directives that can be added to the user test suite.
# DO NOT use them in the default config file(s).

# Override the default testSuite.
#
# Pavilion looks for the default test file definition in the same directory as the
# user test suite, given as the input argument.
# To use a different default file, place this directive 
# in the user test suite file. Use a fully qualified path/name and file.
# DefaultTestSuite: new_default_test_suite.yaml
#
# Include other test suites to create a "Super" test suite
# 
# To build up a test suite from multiple files, include a comma separated list of 
# file names including the relative path to the main user file.
# Two levels deep are supported.
# IncludeTestSuite: [ first_test_suite.yaml, second_test_suite, ...] 



# ------------ Test Stanza Definition ---------------------

  # Working space section

    # A Script called at the end of the test/job.
    # By default, the test harness requires an entry in the job output
    # (see pass or faile matching pattern) located at the beginning of a line
    # followed by a pass or fail. Of course, there are many ways to provide this,
    # but if it's not added by the job itself this may be a convient way to post-process 
    # the results and add this entry.
    # *** If defined, make sure it's executable  
    epilog_script: ""
