# YAML        

#   Default test configuration file, vers. 0.2 

# NOTE - all CAPS variable are env vars

#    All entires can be re-defined by a users test config
#    file (found in PV_HOME/test_conf) with defaults inherited
#    from this file.
#    In theory, the entire default file can be used, but we recommend
#    making a copy, editing at least the name, location, and
#    runcmd sub-elements and removing everything else you don't need.

#    All values are available through:

# A new named stanza is needed for each new test,
