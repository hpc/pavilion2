#   Default test configuration file, vers. 0.7 

# --------  Basic Instructions -------------

# This file contains what a complete single stanza in a user test suite 
# will contain. Each stanza (test entry), of which there can be as many as
# wanted in the user test suite, will inherit each of its components
# from this configuration, unless re-defined.
# Therefore, if you want to effect all the entries during all runs,
# change this file, otherwise change only the appropriate parts of the user test suite.

# NOTE
#  - All variables in CAPS are nix environment vars
#  - Lines with a "#" are comments.

# For each new test stanza, only define what's different from the
# this default test_config file. Simply ommit the part(s) you want to
# inherit.
# In theory, ever part of the default file could be re-used, in practice it's
# necessary to at least changing the Id, name, location, and run:cmd sub-elements
# for each new test.
#

# for YAML formatting issues try: http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com

# It is HIGHLY recommended that you make a copy of this file and tweak it as
# needed and make this new file the default_test_config.yaml file.
    

# ---------- Special Directives Section -------------------------------

# These are examples of reserved directives that can be added to the user test suite.
# DO NOT use them in the default config file(s).

# Override the default testSuite.
#
# Pavilion looks for the default test file definition in the same directory as the
# user test suite, given as the input argument.
# To use a different default file, place this directive 
# in the user test suite file. Use a fully qualified path/name and file.
# DefaultTestSuite: new_default_test_suite.yaml
#
# Include other test suites to create a "Super" test suite
# 
# To build up a test suite from multiple files, include a comma separated list of 
# file names including the relative path to the main user file.
# Two levels deep are supported.
# IncludeTestSuite: [ first_test_suite.yaml, second_test_suite, ...]
