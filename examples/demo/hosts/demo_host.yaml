# Host files take all the same options as test configs in a suite file, 
# except without the test naming level.

# Host configs are selected based on the name of the cluster, based on the
# output from the Pavilion `sys_name` plugin. See `pav show sys_vars` for 
# the value.  For this demo directory, we have a sys_name plugin that 
# always returns the name 'demo_host', so this file will always be used.

# Always run our demo tests on the raw scheduler (bash)
scheduler: raw

# Module wrappers allow you to change how Pavilion handles 
# different module requests from machine to machine.
module_wrappers:

  # Whenever gcc is asked for, we'll do nothing since it should be installed 
  # locally. 
  gcc: 
    env:
      # We could export environment variables here, but we don't need to.
      # PATH: "${PATH}:/path/to/gcc/bin"

    modules: 
      # This would be a list of modules to load/unload swap whenever gcc is asked for.
      # For example, on a Cray Shasta machine we might have to swap out PrgEnv modules.
      # - 'PrgEnv-cray->PrgEnv-gnu'   # The arrow means to swap
      # - 'gcc->gcc'                  # Swap to the correct gcc.

# We can set common variables for use across our test suites
variables:
  compilers: 
    # We can permute across all of a systems compilers
    - name: gcc
      module: gcc
    - name: intel
      module: intel

  filesystems:
    # We can permute over these, and even downselect by type in our tests.
    - path: /lustre/scratch3/{{user}}  # This path will include the user from a pavilion var.
      type: lustre
    - path: /usr/projects/hpctest
      type: nfs
    - path: /tmp
      type: tmp
