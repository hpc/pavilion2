    summary: Run all supermagic tests.

    doc: |

      This test verifiest the MPI communication and parallel communication to
      the scratch spaces.  Failures can occur if a scratch space is not mounted.
      If it's just the convenience mount on a TOSS system and the yeti-scripts
      rpmquery test fails as well, the admins need to run the yeti-script to
      colorize the node and put those mounts in place.

    variables:
      # The question mark at the end of the variable names denote that 
      # these are expected to be set in the hosts file. See hosts/__example_host_file.yaml
