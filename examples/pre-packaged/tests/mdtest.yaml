  summary: Metadata filesystem performance
  doc: |
    MDtest is an MPI-based application for evaluating the metadata performance of a 
    file system and has been designed to test parallel file systems. MDTest is not a 
    Lustre-specific benchmark and can be run on any POSIX-compliant file system, but 
    it does require a fully installed and configured file system implementation in 
    order to run. For Lustre, this means the MGS, MDS and OSS services must be 
    installed, configured and running, and that there is a population of Lustre 
    clients running with the Lustre file system mounted.
