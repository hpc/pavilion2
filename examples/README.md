# Example Tests

This directory contains example tests written for Pavilion, targetting a generic Linux based
cluster. They can fairly easily modified to handle different MPI layers and compilers. 

## Full-Env

This example is one way to setup a full testing environment under Pavilion. The tests here are all
effectively noops that can run on a cluster without a scheduler.  This demonstrates not only 
basic test configuration, but also host, mode, and plugin writing as well.

## Tutorials

This directory contains tests meant to be used as part of the Pavilion test writing tutorial. 

## Pre-Packaged

These tests are meant to run (mostly) out of the box. They demonstrate basic Pavilion features
and provide a starting point for writing your own tests.

## Acceptance

These tests are part of the acceptance testing suite for the Crossroads cluster. They are
meant to be used as a starting point for writing acceptance tests.
