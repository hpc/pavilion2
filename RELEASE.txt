# Release History

## 2.2 Release notes
 - All new test config parser.
 - Variable references are now 'expressions'.
   - In addition to variables, they can contain math and functions.
     - `'hello {{world * 2}}'`
     - Assuming 'world' has a value of 5, would be: 'hello 10'
 - Iterations (formerly sub-strings) can now contain more than one variable.
   This results in all combinations of the variables being used.
   - `'Greetings: [~hello {{name}}{{num}}~,]'`
   - With `name: ['bob', 'janet']` and `num: [1,2]` would result in:
   - 'Greetings: hello bob1, hello bob2, hello janet1, hello janet2'
 - per test permissions settings
   ```yaml
   mytest:
     group: secret_group
     umask: '007'
   ```
 - Backwards compatibility breaks
   - All duplicate keys in configs are now detected and cause errors.
   - Default values may no longer be specified using '{{foo?}}'
   - Dashes are no longer allowed in Pavilion variable names.
     - `'{{name-len}}'`
   - You can no longer have nested 'sub-strings' (now called iterations).
   - Not everything can be escaped in Pavilion strings anymore. This is now
     limited to all normal python escapes
     (https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/strings.html),
     plus '[', '{', and '~'.
   - The results section is now 'result_parse'
   - Result parsers plugins now have explicit argument default and validation settings, 
     and the _check_args method must return the modified argument dictionary.
     (rather than None before)

   ```yaml
   mytest:
     variables:
       unit_base: 100
     result_parse:
       regex:
          speed: 
            regex: 'speed (\d+)'
     result_evaluate:
       speed_normalized: "speed / {{unit_base}}"
       another_thing: '"some don''t string"'
   ```
   - build.source_location has changed.
   ```yaml
   mytest:
     build:
       source_path: mytest.zip
       source_url: http://github.com/hpc/mytest/latest.zip
       source_download: latest

 - Build are now built in their final location, rather than in a tmp 
   location. This fixes the issues with symlinks (as they no longer 
   move, so they can be absolute), and issues with non-relocatable 
   builds.

 - New config keys:
   - 
   ```yaml
   mytest:
     maintainer:
       name: Paul Ferrell
       email: pferrell@lanl.gov
    ```

 - Moved build code into its own module
 - Added include/exclude_nodes option to slurm.
 - Added a 'build' command. Like the 'run' command, but only builds.
