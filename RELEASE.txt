# Release History

## 2.2 Pre-release notes
 - All new test config parser.
 - Variable references are now 'expressions'.
   - In addition to variables, they can contain math and functions.
     - `'hello {{world * 2}}'`
     - Assuming 'world' has a value of 5, would be: 'hello 10'
 - Iterations (formerly sub-strings) can now contain more than one variable.
   This results in all combinations of the variables being used.
   - `'Greetings: [~hello {{name}}{{num}}~,]'`
   - With `name: ['bob', 'janet']` and `num: [1,2]` would result in:
   - 'Greetings: hello bob1, hello bob2, hello janet1, hello janet2'
 - Backwards compatibility breaks
   - All duplicate keys in configs are now detected and cause errors.
   - Default values may no longer be specified using '{{foo?}}'
   - Dashes are no longer allowed in Pavilion variable names.
   - You can no longer have nested 'sub-strings' (now called iterations).
   - Not everything can be escaped in Pavilion strings anymore. This is now
     limited to all normal python escapes
     (https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/strings.html),
     plus '[', '{', and '~'.
   - The results section is now 'results.parse'

   ```yaml
   mytest:
     results:
       parse:
         regex:
            - key: stuff
              regex: 'stuff (\d+)'
   ```
