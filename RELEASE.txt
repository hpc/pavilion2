# Release History

## 2.3 Release Notes
 - Added 'flatten_results' option to the base Pavilion config. Allows for
   producing a separate result log line for each 'per_file' result, making
   charting in Splunk significantly easier. The results can be significantly 
   larger, however, expecially on large machines.
 - Added unified test run filtering in 'status' and 'result'.
 - Added the 'list' command for searching test runs and series
 - Added 'maint' command for maintanence operations.
 - Results now include a 'uuid' key - A completely unique id for each test.
 - Modules may now have nested paths (True lmod module organization)

 - Backwards compatibility breaks
   - 'fn' and 'n' result fields have been merged into 'per_file'.
   - The 'status', and 'result' commands now search all available test runs
     and select recent (1 day) tests by the current user on the current 
     machine. For the old behavior, use ``pav status last``, etc. 
   - Old tests will lack some expected properties for searching, 
     as that information has been consolidated into the 'attributes' file
     which they won't have.
   - 'test_node_list' in the results has been replaced with the much shorter
     'test_node_list_short' key.
   - The results command '-l' (--show-logs) option is now '-L'.

## 2.2 Release notes
 - All new test config parser.
 - Variable references are now 'expressions'.
   - In addition to variables, they can contain math and functions.
     - `'hello {{world * 2}}'`
     - Assuming 'world' has a value of 5, would be: 'hello 10'
 - Iterations (formerly sub-strings) can now contain more than one variable.
   This results in all combinations of the variables being used.
   - `'Greetings: [~hello {{name}}{{num}}~,]'`
   - With `name: ['bob', 'janet']` and `num: [1,2]` would result in:
   - 'Greetings: hello bob1, hello bob2, hello janet1, hello janet2'
 - per test permissions settings
   ```yaml
   mytest:
     group: secret_group
     umask: '007'
   ```
 - Backwards compatibility breaks
   - All duplicate keys in configs are now detected and cause errors.
   - Default values may no longer be specified using '{{foo?}}'
   - Dashes are no longer allowed in Pavilion variable names.
     - `'{{name-len}}'`
   - You can no longer have nested 'sub-strings' (now called iterations).
   - Not everything can be escaped in Pavilion strings anymore. This is now
     limited to all normal python escapes
     (https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/strings.html),
     plus '[', '{', and '~'.
   - The results section is now 'result_parse'
   - Result parsers plugins now have explicit argument default and validation settings,
     and the _check_args method must return the modified argument dictionary.
     (rather than None before)

   ```yaml
   mytest:
     variables:
       unit_base: 100
     result_parse:
       regex:
          speed:
            regex: 'speed (\d+)'
     result_evaluate:
       speed_normalized: "speed / {{unit_base}}"
       another_thing: '"some don''t string"'
   ```
   - build.source_location has changed.
   ```yaml
   mytest:
     build:
       source_path: mytest.zip
       source_url: http://github.com/hpc/mytest/latest.zip
       source_download: latest

 - Build are now built in their final location, rather than in a tmp
   location. This fixes the issues with symlinks (as they no longer
   move, so they can be absolute), and issues with non-relocatable
   builds.

 - New config keys:
   -
   ```yaml
   mytest:
     maintainer:
       name: Paul Ferrell
       email: pferrell@lanl.gov
    ```

## 2.1.2
 - Fixed some regressions from the 2.1.1 release.

## 2.1.1

 - Updated reserved result parser key list. Renamed 'errors' to 'pav_result_errors'.
 - and many smaller bug fixes.
 - Updated yaml_config version.
 - Updated the ls and cat commands, merged the tree command into ls.
 - Moved build code into its own module
 - Added include/exclude_nodes option to slurm.
 - Added a 'build' command. Like the 'run' command, but only builds.
 - Added '--rebuild' option to both build and run (and the capability to do so)
 - Added better build tracking output and verbosity under the 'run' command.


## 2.1

   - test variables are now saved in the test run directory.
 - Fixed RUN_COMPLETE files. They are now made when a test is finished,
   fails, is cancelled, and in most error cases.
