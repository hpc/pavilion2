Pavilion Development Guidelines
===============================

Style
-----

1. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines, even the parts you don't like (80 char
   width).
2. Write docstrings using sphinx style for everything. (The Yaml\_config
   library is a good example.) Including docstring type annotations is
   highly recommended.
3. Keep modules fairly independent from each other.
4. Write regression/unit tests for new functionality and place them in
   test/tests/.
5. Merges must be approved by pflarr, for now.

Publishing
----------

1. **Do NOT increment the version number.** You may want to look at
   `ARBITRARY\_NUMBER.txt <../RELEASE.txt>`__ though.

Site Specific Code
------------------

Site specific code should go into plugins that reside in a separate
repository, and **never** the main Pavilion repository. All Pavilion
code should be targeted towards interoperability with commonly available
products such as slurm, env modules, or lmod.
