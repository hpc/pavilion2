  High Performance Computing clusters require a diverse set of tests to verify that the system meets the
desired and designed performance, stability, and correctness objectives.  This testing will often take place
before and after it's shipped to the customer and after significant system changes take place when in production.
To efficiently use a set of tests that may have very different setup, command-line, and result footprints a
framework must be created that can wrap all these tests and produce a common set of interpretable results. 
  This software, called Pavilion, is such a framework. Many of its underlying ideas come from a framework
developed between 2007 and 2013. The old framework wasn't adaptable to systems using a scheduler other than
Moab, nor was it structured in such a way to be developed in a collaborative way. These two objectives, along
with some other feature requests, are the drivers behind developing and deploying this new product. In and of
itself it does not contain any tests, but is the mechanism for running (in a straight forward, hopefully simple way)
and then analyzing the results of a set of tests.
