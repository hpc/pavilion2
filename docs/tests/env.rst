.. _tests.env:

Build and Run Environments
==========================

Setting up your environment is crucial for running and building tests,
and Pavilion gives you several options for doing so.

-  `Environment Variables <#environment-variables>`__
-  `Modules <#modules>`__
-  `Module Wrappers <#module-wrappers>`__
-  `Spack Packages <#spack-packages>`__

Assumptions
-----------

Pavilion assumes that it runs under a relatively clean, default login
environment; ie the login environment a new user might get when they log
into the machine for the first time, including any default modules or
environment variables. This is **not required**, but simply means that
when you run Pavilion, it will work the same as when your co-worker
does.

That aside, most basic changes won't have a significant impact on
Pavilion. However, a few things will: - Changing from the default
Python3 or PYTHONPATH - Modifying LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH or similar variables
that affect compilation.

Lastly, Pavilion writes and runs *BASH* scripts. It assumes that
whatever your environment is, the module system will work under *BASH*
just as well as your native environment.

.. _tests.env.variables:

Environment Variables
---------------------

The ``env`` attribute allows you to set environment variables in either
the *run* or *build* scripts. They are configured as a YAML
mapping/dict, and (unlike the rest of Pavilion) can have upper-case keys
(but no dashes). Like with the run/build commands, the values can
contain any bash shell syntax without issue.

.. code:: yaml


    env_example:
      run:
        env:
          PYTHONPATH: $(pwd)/libs
          TEST_PARAM1: 37
          # The starting { means this has to be quoted.
          AN_ARRAY: "{hello world}"

        cmds:
          - for value in ${AN_ARRAY[@]}; do echo $value; done
          - python3 mytest.py

Each set variable is set (and \_exported) in the order given.

.. code:: bash

    #!/bin/bash

    export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/libs
    export TEST_PARAM1=37
    export AN_ARRAY={hello world}

    for value in ${AN_ARRAY[@]}; do echo $value; done
    python3 mytest.py

Escaping
~~~~~~~~

Values are not quoted. If they need to be, you'll have to quote them
twice, once for YAML and once for the quotes you actually need.

.. code:: yaml


    quote_example:
      run:
        env:
          DQUOTED: '"This will be in double quotes. It is a literal string as far
                   as YAML is concerned."'
          SQUOTED: "'This $VAR will not be resolved in bash, because this is single
                   quoted.'"
          DDQUOTED: """Double quotes to escape them."""
          SSQUOTED: '"That goes for single quotes '' too."'
          NO_QUOTES: $(echo "YAML only quotes things if the first character
          is a quote. These are safe.")

.. code:: bash

    #/bin/bash

    export DQUOTED="This will be in double quotes. It is a literal string as far as YAML is concerned."
    export SQUOTED='This $VAR will not be resolved in bash, because this is single quoted.'
    export DDQUOTED="Double quotes to escape them."
    export SSQUOTED="That goes for single quotes '' too."
    export NO_QUOTES=$(echo "YAML only quotes things if the first character is a quote. These are safe.")


.. _tests.env.modules:

Modules
-------

Many clusters employ module systems to allow for easy switching between
build environments. Pavilion supports both the environment (TCL) and the
LMOD module systems, but other module systems can be supported by
overriding the base :ref:`plugins.module_wrappers`.

Loading modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In either *run* or *build* configs, you can have Pavilion import modules
by listing them (in the order needed) under the *modules* attribute.

.. code:: yaml

    module_example:
      build:
        modules: [gcc, openmpi/2.1.2]

In the generated build script, each of these modules will be both loaded
and checked to see if they were actually loaded.

.. code:: bash

    #/bin/bash

    TEST_ID=$1

    module load gcc
    # This checks to make sure the module was loaded. If it isn't the script
    # exits and updates the test status.
    is_module_loaded gcc $TEST_ID

    module load openmpi/2.1.2
    is_module_loaded openmpi/2.1.2 $TEST_ID

Other Module Manipulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also unload and swap modules.

.. code:: yaml

    module_example2:
      build:
        source_location: test_code.xz
      run:
        # This assumes gcc and openmpi are already loaded by default.
        modules: [gcc->intel/18.0.4, -openmpi, intel-mpi]
        cmds:
          - $MPICC -o test_code test_code.c

.. _tests.env.module_wrappers:

Module Wrappers
---------------

Module wrappers allow you to change how Pavilion loads specific modules,
module versions, and even modules in general. The default module wrapper
provides support for lmod and tmod, generates the source to load
modules within run and build scripts, and checks to see if they've been
successfully loaded (or unloaded).

Module wrappers are added, typically in :ref:`basics.host_configs`, via the ``module_wrappers``
sections:

.. code:: yaml

  # This would be in a a 'host' file, typically
  module_wrappers:
      gcc:
        # When gcc is asked for on this system, load these modules instead.
        modules:
            # This assumes PrgEnv-cray is the default on this machine.
            - PrgEnv-cray->PrgEnv-gnu
            # Swap the default gcc (that comes with the PrgEnv) for the requested one
            # You shouldn't specify versions (unless you want to force a version), Pavilion
            # will automatically ask for the version asked for by
            - gcc->gcc
        env:
            # You can also add environment variables to automatically be exported after
            # the module is loaded.
            PAV_CC: '$CC'
            PATH: '$PATH:$(dirname $(which gcc))'

So now, we can write our tests to generically ask for 'gcc':

.. code:: yaml

    mytest:
        run:
            modules: 'gcc'

Wildcards
~~~~~~~~~

The modules specified can be written as file system globs, to match a wider range of modules and
to support module naming (particularly under lmods) that is less generic.

.. code-block:: yaml

    module_wrappers:
        # On this system, the modules for MPI layers have the compiler as part of the name.
        # This will match 'openmpi-gcc', 'openmpi-intel', etc.
        openmpi-*:
            modules:
                # This will be auto-converted into the mpi requested.
                - 'openmpi-*'

            env:
                PAV_MPICC: '$(which mpicc)'

Wildcards work on the left side of module swaps (``modA->modB``) as well. Pavilion will look for a
loaded package that matches the left side, and swap it for the right side.

Version Variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need the version of the loaded module, it's available in the '<mod_name>_VERSION'
environment variable. If the the mod_name contains wildcards, '*' is replaced with 'any', and
other characters are replaced with underscores. So ``gcc-[f]-?-*`` gets a 'gcc-_-_-any_VERSION'
environment variable.

Module Wrapper Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For more complicated use cases, you can also write module wrapper plugins. For more information
on writing these, see :ref:`plugins.module_wrappers`.

.. _tests.env.spack_packages:

Spack Packages
--------------

Pavilion supports both the installation and loading of Spack packages inside of
test scripts. This is not enabled by default as it requires an external Spack
instance.

Once configured, Spack packages can be installed and loaded in Pavilion test
scripts using the 'spack' section inside both the 'build' and 'run' sections of
a test config. This section has two keys, 'install' and 'load', that take a list
of package names with optional spec and dependency options.

.. code-block:: yaml

    build:
        spack:
            install:
                - ember
                - mpich@3.0.4
                - mpileaks @1.2:1.4 %gcc@4.7.5 +debug
            load:
                - gcc
    run:
        spack:
            load:
                - ember
                - mpich
                - mpileaks

Pavilion will also allow for Spack specific configuration changes to be added
inside test configs under the 'spack' section. The following Spack specific
options are currently supported:

- build_jobs - The max number of jobs to use when running `make` in parallel.
- repos - Paths to package repositories.
- mirrors - URLs that point to a directories that contain Spack packages.
- upstreams - Other Spack instances.

These are directly inserted into the Spack build environment's spack.yaml
file. Refer to Spack documentation on usage for these.

.. code-block:: yaml

    base:
        spack:
            build_jobs: 4
            mirrors:
                MIRROR1: https://a_spack_mirror.com
            repos:
                - /a/path/to/package/repo
                - /a/different/path/to/package/repo
            upstreams:
                Upstream1:
                    install_tree: /path/to/other/spack/instance

Enabling Spack Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spack features can be added by providing a Spack instance's path
under the ``spack_path`` key in the Pavilion config file (``pavilion.yaml``).
For more Pavilion configuration information, see
:ref:`config`.

Once Spack is enabled globally for Pavilion, it can be enabled for individual
tests simply by including a spack.load or spack.install key under the run or
build sections of a test config. Trying to use Spack in a test when it is not
globally enabled first results in an error.

How Pavilion Uses Spack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Spack is enabled inside of a test config, Pavilion generates an anonymous
Spack environment file that is activated at the beginning of both the build and
run scripts. The generated environment file, ``spack.yaml``, is placed in the
respective build directory so that it can be reactivated when a build is reused.

The Spack environment file is modified so that Spack packages are installed
inside their respective build directory in a directory named ``spack_installs``,
as seen below:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # SPACK: Spack environment configuration file.
    spack:
        config:
            install_tree: ~/.pavilion/builds/7a3986a56e7c04a7/spack_installs

This means any installs that are not in the global Spack instance will only be
in the scope of this build.

Global Spack packages or packages in upstreams will still require to be listed
under the install section for both the build and run sections of a test config
so that those packages can be added to the Spack environment correctly.
