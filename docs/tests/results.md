# Test Results

Every successful test run generates a set of results in JSON. These are saved 
with the test, but are also logged to a central `results.log` file that is 
formatted in a Splunk compatible manner. 

These results contain several useful values, but that's just the beginning. 
[Result Parsers](#using-result-parsers) are little parsing scripts that can 
configured to parse data from your test's output files. They're designed to 
be simple enough to pull out small bits of data, but can be combined to 
extract a complex set of results from each test run. Each result parser is 
also a [plugin](../plugins/result_parsers.md), so you can easily add custom 
parsers for tests with particularly complex results.

 - [Basic Result Keys](#basic-result-keys)
 - [Using Result Parsers](#using-result-parsers)

## Basic Result Keys
These keys are present in the results for every test, whether the test passed
 or failed. 
 
 - __name__ - The name of the test.
 - __id__ - The test's run id.
 - __created__ - When the test run was created. 
 - __started__ - When the test run actually started running in a scheduled 
 allocation.
 - __finished__ - When the test run finished.
 - __duration__ - How long the test ran. Examples: `0:01:04.304421` or 
 `2 days, 10:05:12.833312`
 - __result__ - The PASS/FAIL result of the test.
 
All time fields are in ISO8601 format, with timezone offsets.
 
#### result
The 'result' key denotes the final test result, and will always be either 
'__PASS__' or '__FAIL__'.  

By default a test passes if it's run script returns a zero result, which 
generally means the last command in the test's `run.cmds` list also returned 
zero.

Result Parsers may override this value, but they must be configured to return
a single True or False result. Anything else results in a __FAIL__. 

When using the result key the 'store_true' and 'store_false' 
[actions](#actions) are the only valid choices. Any other action will be 
changed to 'store_true', and the change will be noted in the result errors. 
Similarly, [per_file](#per_file-manipulating-multiple-file-results) can only
have a setting that produces a single result ('store_first' is forced by 
default).

## Using Result Parsers

The `results` section of each test config lets us configure additional result
 parsers that can pull data out of test output files. By default each parser 
 reads from the run log, which contains the stdout and stderr from the run 
 script and your test.
 
```yaml
mytest:
  scheduler: raw
  run:
    cmds:
      - ping -c 10 google.com
   
  results:
    # The results section is comprised of configs for result parsers,
    # identified by name. In this case, we'll use the 'regex' parser.
    regex: 
      # Each result parser can have multiple configs.
      - {
        # The value matched will be stored in this key
        key: loss
        # This tells the regex parser what regular expression to use.
        # Single quotes are recommended, as they are literal in yaml.
        regex: '\d+% packet loss'
      }
      - {
        # We're storing this value in the result key. If it's found 
        # (and has a value of 'True', then the test will 'PASS'.
        key: result
        regex: '10 received'
        # The action denotes how to handle the parser's data. In this case
        # a successful match will give a 'True' value.
        action: store_true
      }
``` 

The results for this test run might look like:
```json
{
  "name": "mytest",
  "id": 51,
  "created": "2019-06-18 16:00:35.692878-06:00",
  "started": "2019-06-18 16:00:36.744221-06:00",
  "finished": "2019-06-18 16:01:39.997299-06:00",
  "duration": "0:01:04.304421",
  "result": "PASS",
  "loss": "0% packet loss"
}
```

### Keys
The key attribute is required for every result parser config, as Pavilion needs
to know under what key in the results to store the parsed result. The 
default result keys (`id`, `created`, etc) are not allowed, with the 
exception of `result`.

#### The `result` key
The result key must always contain either a value of `PASS` or `FAIL`. 
Setting the `result` key allows you to override the default behavior by 
setting this value according to the results of any result parser, but there 
are a few special behaviors:
 
 - The result value must be either `true` or `false`.
 - The [action](#actions) must either be __store_true__ or __store_false__. 
 Pavilion overrides the normal __store__ default and replaces it with 
 __store_true__.
 - If the `result` value is `true`, `PASS` is stored. The result is otherwise
  set to `FAIL`.

### Result Value Types
Result parsers can return any sort of json compatible value. This can be a 
string, number (int or float), boolean, or a complex structure that includes 
lists and dictionaries. Pavilion, in handling result values, groups these 
into a few internal categories.
  - __empty__ - An empty result is a json `null`, or an 
  empty list. Everything else is __non-empty__.
  - __match__ - A __match__ is a __non-empty__ result that is also 
  not json `false`.
  - __false__ - False is special, in that it is neither __empty__ nor a 
  __match__.

The _actions_ and _per_file_ sections below work with these categories when 
deciding how to handle result parser values.

### Actions

We saw in the above example that we can use an _action_ to change how the 
results are stored. There are several additional _actions_ that can be
selected:

  - __store__ - (Default) Simply store the result parser's output.
  - __store_true__ - Store `true` if the result is a __match__ (non-empty and 
  not false)
  - __store_false__ - Stores `true` if the result is not a __match__.
  - __count__ - Count the length of list matches, regardless of contents. 
  Non-list matches are 1 if a match, 0 otherwise.

### Files

By default, each result parser reads through the test's `run.log` file. You 
can specify a different file, a file glob, or even multiple file globs to 
match an assortment of files. The files are parsed in the order given.


If you need to reference the run log in addition to other files, it is one 
directory up from the test's run directory, in `../run.log`.

This test runs across a bunch of nodes, and produces an output file for each.
The regex parser runs across each of these, and (because it defaults to 
returning the first found item only) returns that item or `null` for each of 
the files found. What it does with those values depends on the __per_file__ 
attribute for the result parser.

```yaml
hugetlb_check: 
    scheduler: slurm
    slurm: 
      num_nodes: 4
    
    run:
      cmds:
        # Use the srun --output option to specify that results are
        # to be written to separate files.
        - {{sched.test_cmd}} --output="%N.out" env
    
    results: 
      regex:
        # This will override the test result
        key: result
        regex: 'HUGETLB_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=.+'
        # Run the parser against all files that end in .out
        files: '*.out'
        per_file: # We'll demonstrate these settings below
```

### per_file: Manipulating Multiple File Results

The __per_file__ option lets you manipulate how results are stored on a 
file-by-file basis. Since the choice here will have a drastic effect on your 
results, we'll demonstrate each from the standpoint of the test config above.

Let's say the test ran on four nodes (node1, node2, node3, and node4), but
only node2 and node3 found a match. The results would be:
 - node1 - `<null>`
 - node2 - `HUGETLB_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=2M`
 - node3 - `HUGETLB_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=4K`
 - node4 - `<null>`

#### first - Keep the first result (Default)

Only the result from the first file with a __match__ is kept. In this case, 
the value from node1 would be ignored in favor of that of node2:

```json
{
  "hugetlb": "HUGETLB_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=2M",
  "result": "PASS",
  # This would also contain all the default keys, like 'created' and 'id'
  ... 
}
```

#### last - Keep the last result

Just like '__first__', except we work backwards through the files and get the 
last match value. In this case, that means ignoring node4's result and taking
 node3's:

```json
{
  "hugetlb": "HUGETLB_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=4K",
  "result": "PASS",
  ...
}
```

#### all - True if each file returned a True result

By itself, '__all__' sets the key to True if the result values for all the 
files evaluate to True. This means a result of the number 0 or an empty 
string, which may be valid __matches__, will evaluate to `false`. If you 
would like matches to evaluate to `true` regardless of content, use this with
 __store_true__ or __store_false__ as the action.
 
```json
{
  "hugetlb": false,
  "result": "PASS",
  ...
}
```

#### any - True if any file returned a True result

Like '__all__', but is `true` if any of the results evaluates to True.

```json
{
  "hugetlb": true,
 "result": "PASS",
  ...
}
```

#### list - Merge the file results into a single list

For each result from each file, add them into a single list. __empty__ values
are not added, but `false` is. If the result value is a list already, then each
of the values in the list is added.

```json
{
  "hugetlb": ["HUGETLB_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=2M", "HUGETLB_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=4K"],
 "result": "PASS",
  ...
}
```

#### fullname - Stores in a filename based dict.

The result from each file is still stored according to the _key_ attribute, but
in a dictionary by the file's full name instead. This is easier shown than 
explained:

```json
 "node1.out": {"hugetlb": null},
 "node2.out": {"hugetlb": "HUGETLB_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=2M"},
 "node3.out": {"hugetlb": "HUGETLB_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=4K"},
 "node4.out": {"hugetlb": null}
 "result": "PASS",
```

 - When using the __fullname__ _per_file_ setting, the key cannot be `result`.
 - The rest of the file's path is ignored, so there is potential for file name
 collisions, as the same filename could exist in multiple places.

#### name - Stores in a filename (without extension) based dict.

Just like __fullname__, but instead the file extension is removed from 
filename when determine the key to store under. Only the last extension is 
removed, so `foo.bar.txt` becomes `foo.bar`. 

```json
 "node1": {"hugetlb": null},
 "node2": {"hugetlb": "HUGETLB_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=2M"},
 "node3": {"hugetlb": "HUGETLB_DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE=4K"},
 "node4": {"hugetlb": null}
 "result": "PASS",
```

## Errors 
If an error occurs when parsing results that can be recovered from, a 
description of the error is recorded under the `error` key. Each of these is 
a dictionary with some useful values:

```yaml
{
  ...
  "errors": [{
    # The error happened under this parser.
    "result_parser": "regex",
    # The file being processed.
    "file": "node3.out",
    # The key being processed
    "key": "hugetlb",
    "msg": "Error reading file 'node3.out': Permission error"
  }]
}

```
