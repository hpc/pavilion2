Module Wrapper Plugins
======================

Module Wrappers allow you to override the default modulefile loading
behavior in Pavilion scripts. This can be as simple as setting
additional environment variables, to completely changing what module
systems are supported.

A generic Module Wrapper class that supports lmod and and tmod
(environment modules) is provided, but no

How it Works
------------

Whenever Pavilion is told to load, update, or remove a modulefile in a
Pavilion test config's *run* or *build* sections, a Module Wrapper is
used to generate the commands needed to do so.

1. Find the Module Wrapper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The name and version of the module to load are used to look up the
correct Module Wrapper plugin. If no such Module Wrapper exists (or no
specific version was requested), Pavilion matches against un-versioned
wrappers. Finally, a generic Module Wrapper is used

1. Writes a ``module load <module_name>/<module_version>`` line to the
   file.
2. Writes a ``is_module_loaded <module_name> <module_version``

This documentation is a work in progress.
