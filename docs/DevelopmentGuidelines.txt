Pavilion HPC Testing Framework

Guidlines to follow for cohesive team product development.


1. Code - Generally being developed in Python. However, in cases where a shell script or other language makes sense, use it.

1.1 Style

  Idiomatic Python - http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html

1.2 Language References 

 - http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf (nice, but more introductory)
 - http://www.diveintopython3.net


2. Coding Process/Philosphy
-------

2.1 Code Sharing 

2.1.1  Stored at git.lanl.gov/cwi/pavilion (to be move to github asap)

2.1.2  Team development with Git - http://blog.ericbmerritt.com/2011/12/05/team-development-with-git.html

2.2 Directory Structure <INSTALL_DIR>/PAV

2.2.1 All source code under the PAV directory

2.2.1 Add new sub-commands in Plugins, with all "new" support code added to modules directory, under PAV.  

2.2.2 External packages (outside of the standard Python distro) collected under special_pkgs directory, under PAV 

2.3 Unit or Self testing to be used to verify correctness of code before any new release in test directory.

2.4 Use setting up and using Virtual Environments to improve development process

3. Adding new features (please do!)

 - If you want to add a new sub-command it gets placed in the plugins directory under PAV.
   Use one of the existing ones from the plugins directory as an example.
 - New Python code that is not a sub-command gets placed in the modules directory under PAV.
 - If a new feature to Pavilion requires extensive configuration settings, as opposed to arguments passed to it, 
   consider addition a new stanza/section to the default config YAML. A new scheduler of some type would probably
   be a case for this. Both Moab and LDMS use this method. 

4. Suggestions/Constructive Ideas

 - Please add new features to this software. Especially support for new schedulers, new results analysis tools, and
   more unit testing. Also, if you see code that you feel you can improve, have at it. Let us know what you are up by
   sending e-mail to gazebo@lanl.gov and note Pavilion in the subject line.  Code changes and updates to the main trunk of
   the source will be subject to a review for appropriateness.

Thanks,
The Pavilion Development Team
